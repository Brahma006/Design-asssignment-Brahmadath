# Digital IC Design Internship

A collection of digital design assignments implemented in Verilog HDL, organized by day. Each module includes a design file and a corresponding testbench for simulation and verification.

### Day 1
 
#### BCD Adder
A Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) adder that adds two single-digit BCD numbers and produces a BCD result with carry output. Includes correction logic to keep the sum in valid BCD range (0–9).
 
#### Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)
A multi-bit ripple carry adder built by chaining full adder units. The carry propagates sequentially from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

### Day 2
 
#### 2×4 Decoder
A combinational circuit that activates one of four output lines based on a 2-bit input, with an enable signal. Used in memory addressing and demultiplexing applications.
 
#### Universal Shift Register (USR)
A register capable of parallel load, serial shift left, serial shift right, and hold operations, controlled by a 2-bit mode select input.
 
#### D Flip-Flop (DFF)
A positive/negative edge-triggered D flip-flop — the fundamental sequential storage element used in registers, counters, and state machines.
 
#### SR Flip-Flop
A Set-Reset flip-flop with active-high inputs. Demonstrates basic bistable latch behavior with undefined state handling.
 
---
 
### Day 3
 
#### Face Detect
A finite state machine (FSM)-based sequence detector that identifies a specific pattern in a serial input stream — modeled to simulate face/feature detection logic in hardware. Includes design (`fd.v`), testbench (`fd_tb.v`), and documentation (`fd.md`).
 
#### Sequence Detector (Overlapping)
An overlapping sequence detector implemented as a Mealy/Moore FSM that detects a target bit pattern in a continuous input stream, allowing the detected sequence to overlap with the next occurrence. Includes design, testbench, and documentation (`SD.md`).
